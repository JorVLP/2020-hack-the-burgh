# Malfunctional Penguin Game
We all love penguins and we don't want to see their home destroyed. We also wanted it to be fun, and since music and games are fun, Malfunctioning Penguin was born.

The game procedurally generates an ice slide on the ocean, procedurally generated from the frequency wave of a music file input by the user. The user has to repetitively press on the space bar to change direction (from left to right or vice versa) so that the penguin doesn't fall into the water. As the music goes, the slide grows thinner and thinner, making the game more difficult. It also represents the fast increase in temperature and the melting ice cap. Moreover rubbish and sea animals can be seen in the ocean to represent the fauna suffering from climate change and water pollution.
